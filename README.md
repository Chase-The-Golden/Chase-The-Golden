<!-- Intro -->
<h3>Chase Golden, aka @Chase-The-Golden</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Chase! I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science on May 2023 and am currently <strong>open for work</strong>. I aspire to become a developer in the gaming industry and have worked with Unreal Engine; I have experience in C++, C, and SQL - and I've touched on frontend programming as well such as HTML5, CSS3, and JSP thanks to the professional coding bootcamp, <em>Platform by Per Scholas</em>. Currently, I'm working on mastering Python and creating a personal project using Unreal.</p>
<p>If you have any business inquiries for me, please feel free to reach out to me on one of my contacts below.<br>I look forward to a Golden opportunity whenever!</p>
